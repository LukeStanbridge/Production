In regards to a changelog we didn't have a documented list of every change we made.
We would assess all the feedback we recievced or things we needed to change and make new tasks
on the Trello and assign it to the person who was going to complete the task.
All changes were agreed upon before being uploaded as a Trello task.
All tasks are logged in the "Done" section of our trello and pushed up to Source Tree.
The screenshots show a brief glimpse of these as evidence.

We created feedback forms for people to fill out and logged all responses on google docs.
Took screenshots of these forms and responses as evidence.

Bug reports were logged in bug section of Trello as you can see in the screenshot.
